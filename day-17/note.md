I started today session by reading about what name mangling is and how it works.
Then I started the "Media Catalogue" Workshop. I started by defining a class called "Movie".
In this class I defined a __init__ method with self, title, year, director and duration as parameters.
Then I checked if title or director are eighter empyt or just include whitespaces, if so a ValueError will be raised.
I also checked if the year is less then 1895, because thats when the first movie was shot and if durcation is less then 0
cause a movie cannot have a duration of 0. I also defined a __str__ method to a string with the title, year, duration in minutes 
and director. I then added an instance of Movie called movie1, which I put into a try except block. Then I started to define another class
called "MediaCatalog" in which the __init__ method holds an empty list called "items".
It has an add method which appends items to the items list. It also has a result attribute which stores a string which gives back the count and the name
of the items (movies in this case). It uses a for-loop with enumerate starting at Index 1 which appends the number and the movie to result. 
I ended today sesion by a class called "TVSeries" which inhertits the Movie class, so TVSeries is a child class from Movie class.
